## 📖 Overview <a name="about-project"></a>

In this project, we built a basic website that allows users to add/remove books from a list. This was achieved by using JavaScript objects and arrays while using javascript DOM and basic events to dynamically modify the page.

### Project Objectives <a name="project-objectives"></a>

- [x] Implement only a basic UI with plain HTML
- [ ] Create a collection that keeps a list of books (hint: you can use an array of objects for that).
- [x] Create a function to add a new book to the collection, with title and author.
- [x] Create a function to remove a book from the collection (hint: you can use the array filter() method).
- [x] Display all books saved in the collection at the top part of the page.
- [x] Make sure that when a user clicks the "Add" button:
  - [ ] A new book is added to the collection.
  - [x] The new book is displayed on the page.
- [ ] Make sure that when a user clicks the "Remove" button:
  - [x] The correct book is removed from the collection.
  - [x] The correct book disappears from the page.
- [ ] Make sure that data is preserved in the browser's memory by using localStorage.
